Experiments with a view model in mobx

This would be my dream view model data transformation, 
but it seems one truly cannot have the banana without the gorilla and the whole jungle.
The entire graph needs to be rebuilt, every time, no matter what I try.
More surgical updates may still be possible but might require a bit more Mobx knowledge.
I have also tried offloading some of the work to the component hierarchy to no avail.
